            Cloud security, also known as cloud computing security, consists of
            a set of policies, controls, procedures and technologies that work
            together to protect cloud-based systems, data, and infrastructure.
            ... From authenticating access to filtering traffic, cloud security
            can be configured to the exact needs of the business.

            AWS allows you to automate manual security tasks so you can shift
            your focus to scaling and innovating your business. Plus, you pay
            only for the services that you use. All customers benefit from AWS
            being the only commercial cloud that has had its service offerings
            and associated supply chain vetted and accepted as secure enough for
            top-secret workloads.
