            Cloud Computing Services provide information technology (IT) as a
            service over the Internet or dedicated network, with delivery on
            demand, and payment based on usage. Cloud computing services range
            from full applications and development platforms, to servers,
            storage, and virtual desktops.

            Who uses cloud computing services and why?
          </div>
          <div class="mt-5 font-weight-light body-1">
            Corporate and government entities utilize cloud computing services
            to address a variety of application and infrastructure needs such as
            CRM, database, compute, and data storage. Unlike a traditional IT
            environment, where software and hardware are funded up front by
            department and implemented over a period of months, cloud computing
            services deliver IT resources in minutes to hours and align costs to
            actual usage. As a result, organizations have greater agility and
            can manage expenses more efficiently. Similarly, consumers utilize
            cloud computing services to simplify application utilization, store,
            share, and protect content, and enable access from any web-connected
            device.

          <div class="mt-5 font-weight-light body-1">
            Cloud computing services have several common attributes:
          </div>
          <div class="mt-5 font-weight-light body-1">
            <span class="font-weight-bold">1. Virtualization</span> - cloud
            computing utilizes server and storage virtualization extensively to
            allocate/reallocate resources rapidly

          <div class="mt-5 font-weight-light body-1">
            <span class="font-weight-bold">2. Multi-tenancy</span> -resources

          <div class="mt-1 font-weight-light body-1">
            <span class="font-weight-bold">3. Network-access</span> - resources
            are accessed via web-browser or thin client using a variety of
            networked devices (computer, tablet, smartphone)
          </div>
          <div class="mt-1 font-weight-light body-1">
            <span class="font-weight-bold">4. On Demand</span> - resources are
            self-provisioned from an online catalogue of pre-defined
            configurations

            <span class="font-weight-bold"
              >-> Software as a Service (SaaS)</span
            >
            – software runs on computers owned and managed by the SaaS provider,
            versus installed and managed on user computers. The software is
            accessed over the public Internet and generally offered on a monthly
            or yearly subscription.

          <div class="mt-5 font-weight-light body-1">
            <span class="font-weight-bold"
              >-> Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)</span
            >
            – compute, storage, networking, and other elements (security, tools)
            are provided by the IaaS provider via public Internet, VPN, or
            dedicated network connection. Users own and manage operating
            systems, applications, and information running on the infrastructure
            and pay by usage.

            >
            – All software and hardware required to build and operate
            cloud-based applications are provided by the PaaS provider via
            public Internet, VPN, or dedicated network connection. Users pay by
            use of the platform and control how applications are utilized
            throughout their lifecycle.
