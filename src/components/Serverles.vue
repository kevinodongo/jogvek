            Serverless architecture (also known as serverless computing or
            function as a service, FaaS) is a software design pattern where
            applications are hosted by a third-party service, eliminating the
            need for server software and hardware management by the developer.

            When you operate and maintain the servers and operating systems (OS)
            that run your organization’s applications, your system
            administrators must spend time completing simple and repetitive
            tasks, such as applying OS security patches. Instead of scaling up
            by request volume, they must provision servers for peak volume ahead
            of time, while carefully considering availability and durability
            requirements. You might also have to pay for all of this
            overprovisioned infrastructure in advance, instead of paying for
            what you use as you go.

          <div class="mt-5 font-weight-light body-1">
            Though services such as AWS Auto Scaling and AWS Systems Manager can
            reduce these burdens on conventional, VM-based infrastructure, when
            you build your system on serverless technology, you don’t have to
            provision and manage servers. Your administrators don’t have to
            spend time on OS patches, or maintain unused resources to be
            prepared for occasional peak usage. Serverless applications scale to
            meet the precise demand on each component. Reliability and
            fault-tolerance are also largely built-in by default, which
            eliminates much of the design and operations time required for these
            aspects of the system. By building modern applications with
            serverless technologies from the beginning, the whole lifecycle of
            building, deploying, and running applications can also be kept
            secure. When you remove operational complexity, your developers can
            focus their time and energy on building products that delight your
            customers.
