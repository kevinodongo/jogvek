            AWS supports many disaster recovery architectures, from those built
            for smaller workloads to enterprise solutions that enable rapid
            failover at scale. AWS provides a set of cloud-based disaster
            recovery services that enable fast recovery of your IT
            infrastructure and data.

            Business continuity depends on the efficient, uninterrupted flow of
            data across an organization â€“ from operations to sales to
            fulfillment. Even a brief lapse in workload continuity can mean
            thousands of lost sales opportunities, disruption to production, and
            compromised customer trust.

            The causes of those lapses can range from natural disasters to
            mechanical failure or human error. You need a proactive cloud
            disaster recovery strategy that will help you stay up and running in
            the event that your physical infrastructure is unavailable for any
            length of time.

            and easy to shift your disaster recovery strategy to the AWS cloud
