            Digital marketing, online marketing, internet advertising…whatever
            you call it, marketing your company online is a big deal these days.
            After all, internet usage has more than doubled over the past decade
            and this shift has massively affected how people purchase products
            and interact with businesses.

            When you operate and maintain the servers and operating systems (OS)
            that run your organization’s applications, your system
            administrators must spend time completing simple and repetitive
            tasks, such as applying OS security patches. Instead of scaling up
            by request volume, they must provision servers for peak volume ahead
            of time, while carefully considering availability and durability
            requirements. You might also have to pay for all of this
            overprovisioned infrastructure in advance, instead of paying for
            what you use as you go.
